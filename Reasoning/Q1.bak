;; Will not terminate when m = n > 0; for example, (bar 1 1).
;; If we require m ≠ n, then (m-n)2 > 0, so either mn = 0 or q > 0.
;; Therefore the values of m and n are always strictly decreasing.
;; Furthermore, since they decrease by the same amount, they will still not be equal on the recursive call.

;; Always terminates.
;; Note that the second condition is true whenever n is even. So if n is even, then the value on the recursive call is strictly decreasing.
;; Now consider the binary representation of n. The number of 1's in the binary representation stays the same when n is even and decreases by exactly 1 when n is odd.
;; Therefore n can only be odd a finite number of times, and therefore the algorithm terminates.

;; g: nat nat nat -> nat

;; Will not terminate when i is not divisible by the gcd of m and n.
;; If we require that m and n are relatively prime, then the nontermination condition will never hold, and so the algorithm will always stop eventually.

            [else (* m n)]))


;; Always terminates.
;; Note that the base (i.e. terminating) case here is when m+n ≥ 1000.
;; We can see that (m-n) + (n+1)2 > m+n, so whenever the second case holds, the value of m+n is strictly increasing.
;; And the first case can never hold twice in a row. So the function always terminates.
